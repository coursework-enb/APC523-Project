Here we perform a linear stability analysis of the numerical schemes, to see, for example how the spectral radius might react to time step and viscosity.
We solvw the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, where the evolution operator or its adjoint is analyzed to determine if perturbations grow or decay over time.
Using linear problems or linearized versions (e.g., Stokes equations), techniques like normal mode analysis or eigenvalue analysis of the discretized operator can establish necessary conditions for stability by ensuring the spectral radius of the amplification matrix is less than or equal to $1$.
See this [document](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~bobpego/preprints/LLP-preprint.pdf) for example.
